        <h2>About our Kingdom</h2>
        <p>
          In pre-Hellenistic Greco-Roman geography, Colchis (Ancient Greek:
          Κολχίς) was an exonym for the Georgian polity of Egrisi (Georgian:
          ეგრისი) located on the coast of the Black Sea, centered in present-day
          western Georgia. It has been described in modern scholarship as "the
          earliest Georgian formation", which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia,
          would later contribute significantly to the development of the Kingdom
          of Georgia and the Georgian nation.Colchis is known in Greek mythology
          as the destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and
          the Golden Fleece.It was also described as a land rich with gold,
          iron, timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to
          ancient Hellenic city-states.Colchis was populated by Colchians, an
          early Kartvelian-speaking tribe ancestral to the contemporary western
          Georgians, namely Svans and Zans. Its geography is mostly assigned to
          what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the
          present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara,
          Abkhazia, Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia's Sochi and Tuapse districts;
          and present-day Turkey’s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon provinces.
